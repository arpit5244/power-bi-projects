Using Power BI for HR Analytics is a project that involves creating interactive and insightful dashboards using Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool from Microsoft. The objective of the project is to provide HR professionals with meaningful insights into employee data that can be used to drive strategic decision-making.

The project involves collecting and processing data from various HR systems, such as HRIS, performance management tools, and employee surveys. The data is transformed and visualized using Power BI to create customized dashboards that can be tailored to the specific needs of the HR department.

With Power BI, HR professionals can visualize key metrics such as employee turnover rates, performance ratings, and employee engagement levels. These visualizations can be further enriched with demographic filters, drill-down capabilities, and other interactive features, enabling HR professionals to analyze employee data in depth and gain valuable insights.

The ultimate goal of this project is to empower HR professionals to make data-driven decisions that improve employee engagement, retention, and performance. With Power BI, HR professionals can gain insights into employee behavior, identify trends, and track progress towards strategic HR goals. This can lead to more effective HR strategies and improved business outcomes.
